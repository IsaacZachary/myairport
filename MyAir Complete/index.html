                                    Python has a lot of applications. It's used for developing web applications, data science, rapid application development, and so on.
                                    Python allows you to write programs in fewer lines of code than most of the programming languages.
                                    The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. Now it's one of the most popular programming languages.
                                    Python is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop web applications, data science, creating software prototypes and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax.

                                    A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
                                    A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the
                                     applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system,   often shortened to just database.
                                    Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables 
                                    to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. 
                                    Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

                                    C Language is an amazing language when it comes to simplicity of syntax with decent functionality. It is a perfect mix of both, which makes
                                    it the best contender to be taught to students who have just started learning coding, to introduce them into the programming world. 
                                    Our experienced programmers have majored on the C language as its the basic language and the foundations to oher programming languages
